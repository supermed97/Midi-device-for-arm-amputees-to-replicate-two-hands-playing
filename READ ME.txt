100_PERCENTO_note_sender.......  -> new version of 95_note_sender without delay and any print


Chord_basser ................... -> first version of the bass sender but wasnt handling final bytes correctly in second while loop while(a==128)

Chord_basserv1  ...................> handled them correctly with serial.peek() but was having some deadlock until i repressed bass note


Chord_basserv2  ...................> added chord identification to chordvasser v1 BUT DEADLOCK WAS STILL PRESENT 


Chordbasser_first_release ...> fixed deadlock from chord_basserv2
